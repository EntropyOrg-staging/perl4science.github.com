This page is intended to promote all those ways that we use our favorite language to get things done in all scientific disciplines. Go ahead, add links to your project, provide examples and give installation help. Just fork the [website's repo](https://github.com/perl4science/perl4science.github.com), add your content and submit a pull request.

##Useful Projects
* [Perl Data Language](http://pdl.perl.org) - PDL turns Perl into a free, array-oriented, numerical language
* [BioPerl](http://www.bioperl.org/) - a community effort to produce Perl code which is useful in biology
* [PerlGSL](http://p3rl.org/PerlGSL) - new project to provide the [Gnu Scientific Library](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) to Perl with a Perlish feel
