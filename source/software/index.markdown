On of the key features of Perl is CPAN the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network. CPAN is a huge collection of modules published by authors all over the world, there is a module availble to do almost any task. Further, the culture of Perl values testing to ensure the quality of the released material, so much so that there is a [service](http://cpantesters.org) that continually tests the modules on many different combinations of architectures and operating system.


There are of course other scientific Perl projects which are not hosted on CPAN as well.

So CPAN or not here are a list of useful modules and projects, perhaps a blurb about what they do and a link to relevant repositories and documentation. If you have more to add, let me (Joel Berger) know, or [send a pull request]({{ root_url }}/howto).

##Numerical Software

* [Perl Data Language](http://pdl.perl.org) - PDL turns Perl into a free, array-oriented, numerical language
* [PerlGSL](http://p3rl.org/PerlGSL) - new project to provide the [Gnu Scientific Library](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) to Perl with a Perlish feel
* [Math::GSL](http://p3rl.org/Math::GSL) - another wrapper of the GSL for Perl, this one made using [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/)
* [Math::Cephes](https://p3rl.org/Math::Cephes) - a numerical library of mathematical functions

##Biology

* [BioPerl](http://www.bioperl.org/) - a community effort to produce Perl code which is useful in biology
